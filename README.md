Asteroids-Mobile
================

Very simple C++ OpenGL game Asteroids for Android. It is not a sample of perfect C++ code, but a working example of Android game. I hope to improve it in future and add sensors instead of ugly buttons and etc. But for now already half of a year I cannot find a time for it, so I push it into public as is.

It was compiled in:
1. Linux Debian (no problems for Windows, I have appropriate Windows project, so just ping me for it).
2. Eclipse for Android with installed Android NDK.

To compile, please look into Android.mk and replace PATH variable like specified.

Feel free to let me know if you have any problems with it or questions or suggestions.
