Asteroids-Mobile
================

Very simple C++ OpenGL game Asteroids for Android. It is not a sample of perfect C++ code, but a working example of Android game. I hope to improve it in future and add sensors instead of ugly buttons and etc. But for now already half of a year I cannot find a time for it, so I push it into public as is.

It was compiled in:

1. Linux Debian (no problems for Windows, I have appropriate Windows project, so just ping me for it).

2. Eclipse for Android with installed Android NDK.

To compile, please look into Android.mk and replace PATH variable like specified.

I do not have screenshots from mobile at the moment, but this is only a port from my Windows version of this game and looks pretty similar. So, here is screenshots:

Feel free to let me know if you have any problems with it or questions or suggestions.
